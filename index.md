# Introduction

I am a senior red team operator with a specialty in developing exploits and malware, along with previous experience in cloud penetration testing, application security, and incident response. I have conducted offensive engagements against 'traditional' networks comprised of Windows/Linux endpoints and Active Directory as well as networks that use infrastructure located in the cloud with exclusively macOS endpoints.

I have earned certifications including: OSEE, OSMR, OSCE3, OSCP, CRTL, CRTO
